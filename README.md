##New User Travel Prediction Classifier Tool

1.	Topic:  Airbnb uses an online platform as a marketplace to provide hospitality services to travelers around the world that needs a place to stay. Airbnb provides such services in a form of a short-term lodging lease. Airbnb allows users to book unique homes such as apartment rentals, homestays, condos, townhouses, and hotel rooms; this allows users to experience the city as a local. A vast amount of data is collected on these users. This data be used to create machine learning tools to market to users. This project is proposing using big data analytics tools to analyze user behaviors; to make a prediction of which destination will a new guest book their first travel experience? Implementing Machine learning techniques shall be very effective in extracting knowledge from the data sets.

2.	Problem:  To determine in which country a new user will make his or her first booking on Airbnb by analyzing user characteristics as an input.

3.	Relevant Questions: Which classification algorithm can best predict the destination country? Which user variables are an important factor in predicting the destination country?  

4.	Variable Interest: The response variable that will be of interest is the country destination.

5.	Data source: The dataset I plan to use is found in Kaggle [Airbnb New User Bookings ](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/overview). 
•	Variables
o	User data: ID, age, sex, browser type, country destination, avenue through which the user accessed Airbnb, account created, timestamp of first activity and first booking.
o	Web session data: ID, action type, and time elapsed. 
•	Data split – The data was will be split into an 80/20 ratio to acquire a training and testing set. The training set will be used to model each of the algorithms, and the testing set will be used to measure performance of the model such as accuracy. The data split ratio are as follows:
o	Training: 213452 users from 1/01/ 2010 - 6/30/2014.
o	Testing: 62097 users from 7/01/2014 – 9/30/2014.
•	The predictors consist of both Qualitative and quantitative variables. Model shall transform categorical variables into a binary transformation to optimize model performance.

6.	Statistical Method: Methods considered are going to be Random Forest, Neural Network, Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors and and XGBoosting

7.	Proposed work scope: Perform data preparations, exploratory data analysis, implement each statistical method, evaluate model accuracies, compare statistical methods accuracy, and create presentation slide deck.

8.	Relevant Tools: Tableau, Python and Jupiter notebook 

9.	Relevant papers: 

a.	Effectiveness analysis of machine learning classification models for predicting personalized context-aware smartphone usage [1].
b.	Machine learning techniques for classification of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases [2]

10.	Project milestones:
o	Perform Data Preparations.  
o	Perform exploratory Data Analysis.  
o	Implement Statistical Methods.  
o	Evaluate Model Accuracies.  
o	Compare Statistical Methods based on accuracy.  
o	Completion of Presentation Slide Deck.
